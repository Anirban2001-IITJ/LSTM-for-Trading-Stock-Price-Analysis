The implementation of the LSTM-based trading model demonstrates promising potential in forecasting stock prices using historical data and technical indicators. By leveraging indicators like RSI, MACD, Bollinger Bands, and moving averages, the model gains contextual understanding of market trends. The achieved return of approximately 52%, a Sharpe ratio near 0.9, and a moderate maximum drawdown reflect a favorable risk-reward balance. The strategy's performance and visualizations suggest it can assist in generating effective buy/sell signals. However, real-world deployment should consider transaction costs, slippage, and market volatility. Further tuning and ensemble models may enhance prediction robustness and profitability in dynamic financial environments.
